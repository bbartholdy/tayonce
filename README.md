# Tayonce: The best of Beyonce and Taylor Swift

## :musical_note: Example song:

'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it  
I can do for you, what Martin did for the people  
(Let's work it out)  
Spirit, yeah, watch the heavens open, open  
 
That's how I like it, baby  
I, I, I can back it up  
We're standing on the sun  
I need a thug that'll have my back  
 
Diddy Bop, like Sean, John, John  
Perfection is a disease of a nation  
To come home  
You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)  
 
That's how I like it, baby  
I, I, I can back it up  
We're standing on the sun  
I need a thug that'll have my back

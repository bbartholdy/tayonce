# Tayoncé: The best of Beyonce and Taylor Swift

This is an R package inspired by TidyTuesday [week
40](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-29/readme.md),
and was my slightly alternative
[contribution](https://github.com/bbartholdy/tidytuesday/tree/master/29-09-2020).
Generates a song with a verse, 2x chorus, and a bridge, using random
lines from Beyoncé and Taylor Swift songs.

## Installing the package

``` r
devtools::install_github("bbartholdy/tayonce")
```

## :musical\_note: Generate your first (of many) hit song! :musical\_note:

``` r
tayonce::hit_song()
#> ## Chad, blow your horn now ## 
#>  
#>  Stop the world and steal it for you
#> I need too much
#> I swag when I surf
#> When, you touch me 
#>  
#>  Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
#> I see you look me up and down
#> Chad, blow your horn now
#> Do the uh-oh 
#>  
#>  Let's get carried away
#> Don`t bare the burden all by yourself (By yourself)
#> The same old nigga with the pot
#> Got me looking so crazy, your love 
#>  
#>  Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
#> I see you look me up and down
#> Chad, blow your horn now
#> Do the uh-oh
```

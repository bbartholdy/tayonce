## :musical_note: Example song:

It's like you makin' love to me (oh)  
Swizz Beatz  
Baby boy, not a day goes by  
Iâ€™m your suga mama (Suga mama, hey, hey)  
 
 Big homie better grow up  
Cling to me oh and I'll be strong  
That I love  
And economic equality of the sexes  
 
 Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you  
Darling, you got enough for the both of us  
'Cause you're mine  
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humping  
 
 Big homie better grow up  
Cling to me oh and I'll be strong  
That I love  
And economic equality of the sexes

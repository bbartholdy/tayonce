# Tayonc&eacute;: The best of Beyonce and Taylor Swift

This is an R package inspired by TidyTuesday [week 40](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-29/readme.md), and was my slightly alternative [contribution](https://github.com/bbartholdy/tidytuesday/tree/master/29-09-2020). Generates a song with a verse, 2x chorus, and a bridge, using random lines from Beyonc&eacute; and Taylor Swift songs.

## Installing the package

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("bbartholdy/tayonce")
```

## :musical_note: Generate your first (of many) hit song! :musical_note:

```{r}
tayonce::hit_song()
```
